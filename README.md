# Nwassik - Serverless Backend (Ongoing work)

## Project Overview

**Nwassik** is a reverse marketplace platform that connects people who need products or services (Requesters) with people who can fulfill those needs (Providers). The platform focuses on enabling cross-border transactions, particularly between Tunisia and France, where users can request items for purchase and delivery from abroad, items to be picked from one place and delivered to another, or purchasing online services that are not available locally.

### The Main Problem We Solve

- **High import costs**: Tunisian residents face expensive tariffs on imported goods
- **Travelers with spare capacity**: People traveling between countries have unused luggage space
- **Unavailable goods**: Get products or services that are not available locally
- **Peer-to-peer trust**: Connecting verified individuals for mutual benefit
- **Flexible services**: From physical goods (medecines, documents, perfumes,..) to online services (subscriptions, tickets, etc.)

### How It Works (Main Workflow)

1. Registration and login using:
    - Email/password
    - Social sites: Facebook + Google  
2. **Requesters** post what they need:
    - 3 Request types:
      - Buy & Deliver service
        - Users specify what items they want bought and to where should be delivered
      - Pickup & Deliver service
        - Users specify from where items should be picked, and to where should be delivered
      - Online service
        - Users specify what online service they need (Netflix, plane ticket,..) and meetup location for transaction
    - A due date can also be specified indicating the final deadline for completing the request (Possible for all kind of requests)
3. **Providers** browse public requests and offer to fulfill them
    - Support request type, location and due date filtering
4. **Negotiation** happens via private chat messaging
    - This reduces platform liability
5. **Transaction** occurs offline with cash on delivery (future: monetization via online payments)
